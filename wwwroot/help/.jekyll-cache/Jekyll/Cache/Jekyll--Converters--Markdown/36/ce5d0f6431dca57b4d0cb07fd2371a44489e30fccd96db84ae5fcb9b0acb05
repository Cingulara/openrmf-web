<p>OpenRMF<sup>Â®</sup> uses Roles to allow permissions on the front end user interface as well as the backend API calls for interaction with the data and features.</p>

<p>Anyone that has a role has that role for all of the system packages for the entire installation. So be careful when you give out roles to people as they will have that role for every single system package.</p>
