# Using Templates for your Checklists

![OpenRMF Templates](./assets/templates.png)

You can use Templates in OpenRMF for a starting point for your checklists. A great example would be you have an infrastructure package and a platform-as-a-service package that your application(s) run on. That infrastructure and PaaS have known good checklists as a baseline that application owners use as a starting point and adjust the remaining vulnerability items accordingly. 

IT personnel would download this template and then fill out remaining items based on their software or system.


The templates are added via the Upload page in the Template Upload area. The Template listing are user templates that those with permissions have added. The Template name as well as the score of items are shown simimlar to the Checklist listing page. Click the linked Template to view the detailed information. Click the green plus sign to view the scoring based on category.
