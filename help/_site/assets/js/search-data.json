For example, click the CAT 1 OPEN number, and you can filter your vulnerabilities below to only show Category 1 (High severity) Open items.

And it allows assessors to have a single place to view the system and all its checklists so their job is more organized. It has great use cases for everyone!

    "content": "The current way to implement the Risk Management Framework for your DoD Authority to Operate is VERY manual and VERY, VERY slow. VERY slow. It is driven by disparate pieces of a Java Viewer for checklists, massive amounts of MS Excel spreadsheets for viewing the checklists for management, MS Word documents, various PDF files, your own home grown applications to help automate pieces of this process, and more. Information is shared (hopefully!) via email and shared folders. And there is no one central place for developers, operations, management, and cybersecurity analysts to see the most up to date information that is needed to eventually submit to eMASS. That changes with OpenRMF! . OpenRMF solves this dilemma. All you need is a web browser to view the pertinent information on your checklists within your system. Checklists are grouped by system and quickly show information such as the number of Category 1, 2, and 3 items as well as the number of Open items versus the Not a Finding “closed” items. Without having to open every single checklist file in the heavy Java viewer DISA provides. OpenRMF helps in several ways: . | It is 100% browser based for all the major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, IE 11) | You can import multiple checklists for a single source-of-truth for all checklists | You can organize and manage your data by systems for a quicker, less stress filled way to see your system’s risk profile | Reports for management highlight the most asked question on status and numbers of items by type | You can run a single compliance report across all your checklists based on the Low/Moderate/High label as well as PII data included | You can export any checklists to Excel or download a CKL file for viewing in the DISA Java Viewer | You can drill down to your problem areas across all your checklists quickly with a few clicks and get actionable data quickly | . With coming updates such as automating the Risk Assessment Report, automating the POA&amp;M on fixes, as well as online editing of checklist status and comments OpenRMF is the app any DoD IT / Developer / Operations / Cybersecurity professional needs! .

The data is already formatted in a way for very fast retrieval, especially across systems with large numbers of checklists and Nessus Patch data. This data uses an “eventual consistency” pattern. When a new or updated checklist or scan is loaded into OpenRMF, a separate process is kicked off behind the scenes so you can get back to the OpenRMF interface. This process, as an example, pulls the Nessus ACAS Patch data report, parses the data, and puts separate records of the scan results into a particular MongoDB collection for later reporting. “Eventual” does not mean hours later! But it does mean you need to give it processing time. For scans of 4 or 5 machines we are talking a minute or two. For a large system of 100 hosts being scanned, the time required would be more on the lines of 15 minutes or so to process all the data. This of course depends on the amount of data in the scan, the type of scans, the amount of processing power you give OpenRMF and the amount of CPU and Memory in particular you give the Report Message client if you are running something like Kubernetes. Only Administrators can run this. And it is only needed if you want to force a refresh, if you are upgrading from a version before 0.14 and need the data initially loaded, or if your data or system is interrupted and corrupted and you want to ensure the data is right. Right now only those 2 reports use the Report API and database with eventual consistency. There may be more in the future.

And then there are User Templates that you can upload as a starting point for checklists. User Templates can be from other CKL files you have updated to use as a boilerplate, a custom checklist you make in OpenRMF® Professional, or from a default DISA one you have added some special text or details to. In the OpenRMF OSS we include the latest default DISA templates in our template component so you have them for SCAP scans to associate. All default DISA templates have everthing as Not Reviewed so we do not calculate the score on the DISA default templates to speed up page loading. User Templates are added via the Upload page in the Template Upload area. The User Template listing are user templates that those with permissions have added. The Template name as well as the score of items are shown simimlar to the Checklist listing page. Click the linked Template to view the detailed information. Click the green plus sign to view the scoring based on category. For User Templates, we calculate the score of the template for you based on vulnerabilities. You can use Templates in OpenRMF® for a starting point for your checklists. A great example would be you have an infrastructure package and a platform-as-a-service package that your application(s) run on. That infrastructure and PaaS have known good checklists as a baseline that application owners use as a starting point and adjust the remaining vulnerability items accordingly. On the Checklist Template page showing the individual checklist template, you can see the vulnerabilities. You also can click the Create Checklist button to make a new checklist based on the template in a system package you select. IT, Cyber, and other personnel would fill in checklists based on this checklist template when added as a checklist in your system package, and then fill out remaining items based on their software or system.

Then attach your files and click the Upload and Save button. When you upload your files, you will receive a confirmation of the files loading correctly or not. If all works well, the files are saved into the database. And a separate event is fired off to read and “score” the checklist you uploaded to keep track of the number of items by status by category. These are the numbers that show up when you list your checklist. If you upload an XCCDF XML SCAP scan result file (DISA or Nessus SCAP), that file is matched to internal System Templates from DISA’s known good publicly available checklists. That checklist is filled in with pass or fail items from the SCAP scan accordingly. Any vulnerability item not found within the scan is kept as Not Reviewed. This new checklist file is then saved into the database and the scoring process kicks off for it. Note: You must have a single checklist per CKL file. The Java Viewer from DISA allows more than one, however this makes your Cybersecurity personnel’s job harder to do. And it makes the issues harder to track. This tool looks for one checklist per CKL file if that is what you are uploading.
